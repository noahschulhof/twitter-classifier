## Preparing Input Files
After cloning the repository, raw input files can be prepared with the singular command
```bash
$ bash download.sh
```
Please note that this is only necessary if running `preprocess.ipynb`. The data used to train/test the models in `models.ipynb` is available in the `cleaned` folder.
